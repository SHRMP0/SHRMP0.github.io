Congratulations... you'd deserve an award, if there was anything important here.

But jokes aside, welcome to my website. As you've probably noticed, I really like shrimps and capybaras. **What good things will you find here? Honestly, I don't know.** I don't have a clear purpose for this little corner of the internet; All I know is that it belongs to me. That being said, I'll probably just post whatever I find interesting whenever I feel like it, without any specific criteria or frequency.

Will this be relevant enough for other people to become interested in reading the content? Well, we'll see... I already have some ideas, but I just need to overcome the inertia and laziness to start writing them down.
